# n this version of the algorithm, we introduce a parameter p to represent the specified success 
# probability. The algorithm follows a similar structure to the previous version but calculates the upper bound using Chernoff bound based on the specified 
# p. The termination and correctness properties remain similar to the previous algorithm, but now the success probability 
# p is used for calculations and comparisons.
