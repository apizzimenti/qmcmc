# Using Chernoff bound, we calculate an upper bound on the probability that the estimated success rate
# deviates significantly from 2/3. If this upper bound is less than or equal to δ, we return the estimated
# success rate as the output. The algorithm is designed to succeed 2/3 of the time with a probability of at
# least 1 - δ.
